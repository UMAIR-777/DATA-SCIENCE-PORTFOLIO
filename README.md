# Landslide Detection with Hyperspectral Imaging using U-Net

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a U-Net model designed for Landslide Detection using hyperspectral imaging data. The project is developed to identifying and analyzing landslides areas.

## Code Structure

- **Data Preparation:**
  - Modules for loading, preprocessing, and organizing training and validation data in HDF5 format.
  - Training data includes hyperspectral channels relevant to landslide detection.

- **U-Net Model Architecture:**
  - Implementation of a U-Net model using TensorFlow and Keras.
  - Customized for binary segmentation tasks, specifically detecting landslides.

- **Training the Model:**
  - Training script initializes the U-Net model, compiles it with appropriate metrics, and uses callbacks for model checkpointing.
  - Training data is loaded and preprocessed for landslide detection.

- **Validation and Evaluation:**
  - Validation data is loaded and preprocessed similarly to training data.
  - The trained model is evaluated on the validation set, with metrics including loss, accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Organize training and validation data in HDF5 format with hyperspectral channels.
   - Normalize and process data as specified in the provided preprocessing scripts.

2. **Training:**
   - Run the training script, providing paths to training and validation data.
   - The model will be saved, and checkpoints will be created during training.

3. **Evaluation:**
   - After training, use the saved model to evaluate on new hyperspectral data for landslide detection.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- h5py

Tasks
Task 1: Web Scraping and Data Presentation with Sentiment Analysis
The first task involves web scraping reviews from a designated website, followed by data cleaning and presentation. Engage in the exploration of real-world data, extracting valuable insights, and applying sentiment analysis to identify positive and negative reviews. Present your findings in a clear and meaningful manner.

Task 2: Predicting Customer Buying Behavior with Machine Learning Models
For the second task, you will delve into building a predictive model to anticipate customer buying behavior. Explore various models, and discover that the Random Forest model performs exceptionally well. Apply your data science expertise to analyze patterns and factors influencing purchasing decisions, culminating in the creation of a robust model.
